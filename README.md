Through this assignment, I focused alot on understanding the code. I first started out pseudo coding what I wanted the layout of the code to be. Then, I referenced class activities that we did to help me out with the assignment!

<br>



## Criteria:

Within this project, I included:

<center>

```
1. Command-line readme generator
2. User prompts
3. Github APIs
4. Description, email, title ect.
 ```

</center>

## Issues with the project:

</u>

<br>

- At first I tried using an api call with axios.get and was getting confused. 

    -  I solved this issue by using a different, more simple method to get the user image. Below is a snippet of the command-line generated README.md file, that includes the image.
